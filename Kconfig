	help
	  Wait for UART to finish shifting last byte(s). Increase if PuTTY shows missing chars.

config SHELL_RS485_DE_ON_DELAY_US
	int "Delay (us) after DE HIGH before first TX byte"
	default 250
	range 0 1000
	depends on SHELL_BACKEND_SERIAL_RS485_DE
	help
	  Wait for transceiver to drive before sending. Fixes "art:~$" -> "uart:~$".

config SHELL_RS485_DE_MAX_HIGH_MS
	int "Max time (ms) DE stays HIGH; force LOW after to allow RX (Enter)"
	default 10
	range 5 50
	depends on SHELL_BACKEND_SERIAL_RS485_DE
	help
	  Safety: force DE low after this time so device can receive (e.g. Enter key).

menu "Radio Test Configuration"
config RADIO_TEST_USB
	bool "Radio Test shell over USB CDC ACM class"
	depends on SOC_NRF5340_CPUNET
	select EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  Use USB instead of UART as the Radio Test shell transport.
	  For nRF5340 the USB from application core is used as communication interface.

config RADIO_TEST_POWER_CONTROL_AUTOMATIC
	bool "Automatic power control"
	depends on FEM
	default y
	help
	  Set SoC output power and front-end module gain to achieve Tx output power requested
	  by user. If the exact value cannot be achieved, power is set to closest value which does
	  not exceed the limits. If this option is disabled, user has to set SoC output power and
	  fem gain with separate commands.

config RADIO_TEST_RX_TIMEOUT
	int "RX packet reception timeout"
	default 10
	help
	  Specifies the time in seconds that the application waits for the first packet to be
	  received in RX mode when a specified number of packets are set to be received.
	  If the timeout is reached before the first packet is received, the radio will be disabled.
